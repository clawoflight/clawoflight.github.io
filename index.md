## Uni-Gemeinsam

Uni is tough, and it's good to have friends to work with and help each other with our studies. That's why I co-founded a collaboration group as a place to meet people, share insights and get help for debugging ;)

You can find it's homepage [here](/uni).

## Blog

My Blog is probably what you are looking for. You can click on the corresponding menu item in the top right corner, or simply [here](/blog). Details are available in the [about](/about) page.
