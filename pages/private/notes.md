## Thoughts & To-Think

- Calvin: priority of bible study
	+ blogging
	+ commenting
	+ writing a book
	+ teaching
	+ prioritizing the study of the word above all else

## Talk With Lukas

- Reading
	+ Calvin and Edwards think so much about God's glory
	+ Reading more, especially military, history
	+ SPQR wasn't great, but it's not bad
	+ Did you start Clear and Present Danger?
- Work
	+ Tough, but it feels god to be advancing my marriage
	+ It's nice to relax completely over the weekend
- Bolt Action
	+ Second edition coming in fall --> start painting and buy the rules later
	+ History does it for me
	+ Strategic gameplay
	+ A lot of choice in the small things
- Stellaris/Hearts of Iron
- Esperanto (Bible reading is the most valuable thing, I think)
