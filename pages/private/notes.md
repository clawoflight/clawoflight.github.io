## Thoughts & To-Think

- Calvin: priority of bible study
	+ blogging
	+ commenting
	+ writing a book
	+ teaching
	+ prioritizing the study of the word above all else
- Tabletop
	+ 40K gameplay vs. Bolt Action gameplay: time spent moving/thinking as opposed to rolling dices and looking up numbers
	+ Hobby: podcasts/sermons
	+ WW2 realism gives me much more to relate with
- Thinking clearly
	+ Relaxing enough through faith in God's provision
	+ Rest instead of overworking, sleep enough
	+ Not through my strength, but his

## Talk With Lukas

	+ PJs → So much dedication
	+ Calvin → He constantly thinks about God's glory
- Bolt Action: WW2 is an amazing setting, especially for game-play and scenarios -- and there are *so many options!*
- Stellaris
- Esperanto (Bible is the most valuable thing, I think)
