I am currently studying Computer Science in Innsbruck. I am a believing Christian (as you can probably tell from my blog), avid reader (loving John Piper and Tolkien) and used to be a gamer. Now, I spend most of my time with God or programming / Linux related stuff and reading.

Currently running Debian GNU/Linux (testing/Stretch) on my desktop and Arch Linux on my laptop.
