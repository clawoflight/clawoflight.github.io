I really enjoy taking pictures, and I find that they are a great way to rejoice in God's amazing creation. This page contains some of my favorite pictures I hope you will enjoy!
The pictures are taken with a Sony Xperia Z1 Compact and sometimes edited with GIMP or Snapseed.

As usual, everything is CC-BY-SA 4.0, feel free to use my work!
