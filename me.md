I am currently studying Computer Science in Innsbruck. I am a believing Christian (as you can probably tell from my blog), avid reader (loving John Piper and Tolkien) and used to be a gamer. Now, I spend most of my time with God or programming / Linux related stuff.

Currently running Debian GNU/Linux (Jessie), will be switching to testing/Stretch as soon as that calms down. I will eventually switch to Arch though.
