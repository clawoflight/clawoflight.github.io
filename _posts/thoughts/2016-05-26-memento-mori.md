I have have thought quite a bit about how I spend my time in the past weeks. A lot - if not most - of what we do is utterly futile. I see this more than usual because my studies take up so much of my time that I can't do much else, which makes me think thrice about anything I do.

Besides the time I spend with God one way or another (be it in Church, reading the Bible or anything else), I read books, try to find time to spend with friends and play the occasional computer game. I also listen to a few podcasts and an extra sermon every once in a while.

I am also considering getting into a table-top game because building and painting the miniatures would give me something relaxing to do on evenings that doesn't include reading, with the option to think about something or listen to a podcast while doing so, and allow me to replace some of my strategy games with a more communal alternative.

Time is valuable. In fact, it's arguably the most valuable resource any of us have, and it's strictly limited. Which is why I think a lot about the way I spend my time: I want my actions and activities to have an (ideally eternal) impact. Of course, the only way to achieve that is to invest into God's Kingdom.

I am currently reading a great [book][calvin] about Calvin's preaching. I quote Steve Lawson:

>As a result of all this study in the Word, Calvin knew much of it virtually by memory, and most of it was available to him by quick and effective reference. Further, he had assimilated the metaphors and images of the Bible, its concepts and its nuances, into his life and thinking.

>Week after week of careful preparation for his sequential expository preaching produced a soaring view of God that caused Calvin's mind and heart to be stayed upon his Redeemer.

I will try to do more and more of that. I want to soak so much of God's Word that God becomes the highest, most magnificent object of my thought.
