I have decided to start writing again. Because university keeps me very busy, I do not have the time to write long Bible-study posts like I do in the summer. However, I will start putting more of my thoughts to ~~paper~~ pixels and hopefully think more clearly as a result.

I will try to give a glimpse into my reflections on things I have read and current issues as well as discuss things that I do. I tend to write rarely and long, so this will be a good exercise as well.
