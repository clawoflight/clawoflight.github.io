```
and they say, “The Lord does not see; the God of Jacob does not perceive.”
Understand, O dullest of the people! Fools, when will you be wise?
He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see?
He who disciplines the nations, does he not rebuke? He who teaches man knowledge—
the Lord—knows the thoughts of man, that they are but a breath.
```
Psalm 94:7-11

Many people think that there actions don't have any consequences beyond what they immediately see. They think that they can do whatever they want as long as they properly "manage the risks".
However, God clearly says the opposite: *He who planted the ear, does he not hear? He who formed the eye, does he not see? (v. 9)*
