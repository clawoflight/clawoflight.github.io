# Welcome to my new blog!

This blog uses the fancy `jekyll` cms, which is awesome because it's incredibly simple.

I will write about my life with the LORD, the word of God, and occasionally about programming or other computer science / hacker related stuff.

The categories of a post are visible in the url. Each category also has it's own overview page, be sure to check that out if you are only interested in posts of a specific category!
